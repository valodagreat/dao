# DAO CONTRACT

This project is the smart contract of my DAO, where members of the DAO can create proposals, vote for and against proposals and have say in the organization unlike traditional organizations. This project was created, tested, deployed and verified with hardhat.

You can check out the project [here](https://dao-frontend-ten.vercel.app/)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat help
```
